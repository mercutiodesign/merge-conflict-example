# How to resolve a merge conflict without losing data
Additions can sometimes create conflicts even if they do not change any line that another branch had changed.
In this example project you can demonstrate how to resolve a merge conflict.
It's important that no useful change is lost during the merge.

# Change branch
The change branch overwrites a section of the readme with a new line.

It includes multiple paragraphs of text (which should stay together).

# Additional Information
In this branch there is an addition at the end of the file.
This should not overwrite the changes made in the `change` branch.
