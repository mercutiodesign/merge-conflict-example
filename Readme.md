# How to resolve a merge conflict
Additions can sometimes create conflicts even if they do not change any line that another branch had changed.
In this example project you can demonstrate how to resolve a merge conflict.

# Goal
Merge the conflicting branches `change` and `addition` into this master branch.

# Additional Information
In this branch there is an addition at the end of the file.
This should not overwrite the changes made in the `change` branch.
